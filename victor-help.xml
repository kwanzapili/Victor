        === Start up ===
    The engine master switch if OFF
    All engines are OFF
    The electric master is OFF
    The ground power is disconnected
    The hatch is open
    The parking brake is ON

    ========== Start Routine ==========
    There are two types of start available: manual and automatic.

    === Manual Start ===
    Request the Palouste compressor starter => key "Ctrl-E"
    Turn ON the engine master switch => key "#"
    Turn ON the electric master switch => key "}"
    Fire the starter => key ")" or "s"
    The engine will spin up to a maximum of about 25% N2 (5.2% N1)
    The engine cutoff switch is triggered automatically at this stage
    Wait for the engine to to reach about 45% N2
    Select the next engine and fire the starter again => key ")" or "s"
    Wait for all engines to stabilise (~30% N1 and 60% N2)
    The external starter resources are automatically disconnected
    The engine will spin up to a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1)

    === Automatic Start ===
    Request the Palouste compressor starter => key "Ctrl-E"
    Either use the key "~" of select "Auto-start" in the victor menu
    The system will start each engine in turn, including the APU
    When all main engines are running, switch off the APU with key "Ctrl-F"
    The external starter resources are automatically disconnected

    === Taxi ===
    Don't forget to close the hatch => key "d"
    Flaps as necessary
    Parking brake OFF (this also disconnects the external starter)
    Then use the throttle to accelerate

    Run on the ground until VR (depends on weight on payload)
    Take off before ~230 knots to avoid damaging the tyres

    ========== Speeds (AUW 140,000 lbs) ==========
    Rotation:              150 knots
    Initial Climb:         170 knots
    Climb (below 24K ft):  250 knots
    Climb (above 24K ft):  300 knots
    Pattern:               200 knots
    Approach:              190 knots
    Threshold:            160 knots
    Touch down:            135 knots
    Tail Chute:            235 knots

    ========== Fuel ==========
    The plane has partially filled tanks on startup. You can top this up on
    the ground or in the air. Ground refuelling requires the parking brake
    to be ON. Air refuelling requires tanker operations to be active and
    close contact with the tanker. In both cases, make sure the refuelling
    lid is open or no fuel will be taken on.

    The plane normally manages the fuel distribution within the various tanks so
    as to maintain a reasonable centre of gravity. You can assist this process by
    activating forward or aft fuel transfers via the "Fuel Mgt" dialog.
    Cross-feeding is also possible. It enasures equitable fuel levels in the four 
    tank groups. In general, the CoG should be between 17% - 30%, depending on the
    gross weight of the aircraft and payload.

    ========== Auto-flight ==========
    Two separate auto-flight modes exist. The Flight Management Computer (FMC)
    runs the "managed" mode. In this mode, it determines all the lateral,
    vertical and speed parameters. The second mode is run by the Flight Director
    with input from the pilot. This is the "selected" mode. The pilot has a say
    in some or all the lateral, vertical or speed parameters.

    === Managed Modes ===
    Lateral
    ~~~~~~~
    * LEVEL - wings are set to level (tries to maintains current heading)
    * NAV - follow navigation course (from route manager)
    * LOC - follow LOCalizer signal
    * RUNWAY - align with runway heading

    Vertical
    ~~~~~~~~
    * CLB - climb at variable vertical and air speeds to the target height
    * DES - descend at variable vertical and air speeds to the target height
    * ALT - maintain altitude set by the FMC
    * AGL - maintain set elevation above ground
    * CRUISE - maintain cruise altitude (and cruise speed)
    * LEVEL - maintain vertical speed at 0
    * G/S - follow glideslope

    Note that all the above modes control the airspeed via the throttles.
    The pilot has no say in the selected airspeed.

    Speed
    ~~~~~
    * THR CLB - variable airspeed in vertical CLB, ALT, AGL or LEVEL modes
    * THR DES - variable airspeed in vertical DES, ALT, AGL or LEVEL modes
    * CRUISE - pilot set cruise speed used only in vertical CRUISE mode

    === Selected Modes ===
    Lateral
    ~~~~~~~
    * HEADING - maintain heading set by pilot

    Vertical
    ~~~~~~~~
    * OP CLB - climb at variable vertical speed to the target height while
    	maintaining the set airspeed via pitch control
    * OP DES - descend at variable vertical speed to the target height while
    	maintaining the set airspeed via pitch control
    * V/S - maintain a constant vertical speed set by the pilot
    * ALT - acquire or maintain the altitude set by the pilot
    * PITCH - maintain a constant pitch set by the pilot

    Note that unlike managed modes, some selected modes use pitch to control
    airspeed without changing the throttle level (where possible). The pilot
    can adjust the throttle levels are any time and the autopilot will adjust
    the pitch to compensate and return to the set airspeed.

    Speed
    ~~~~~
    * SPEED - maintain a constant speed in knots set by the pilot
    * MACH - maintain a constant Mach speeed set by the pilot

    === Flight Stages and Phases ===
    The FMC divides the flight into several stages:
    	Takeoff ~ Initial Climb ~ Mission (with climb and descend parts) ~
    	Approach ~ Land
    The flight director divides the flight into phases (with some overlap with the
    flight stages)
    	Takeoff ~ Initial Climb ~ Cruise ~ Descend ~ Deceleration ~ Approach ~ Land

    The pilot can define the cruise altitude, cruise speed, and deceleration altitude
    in the "Autoflight" menu. All other pilot inputs are available in the
    "Autopilot" dialog.

    === Autopilot ===
    The autopilot can only be engaged after the "Takeoff" stage is complete (above 400 ft).
    Initially, it starts in "selected" mode. The pilot can change the parameters and each
    mode separately in the "Autopilot" dialog. If "managed" mode is selected for any part,
    e..g lateral, then the pilot will no longer influence that part. If the route manager is
    set and active, then setting all parts to managed allows the plane to fly itself to the
    destination including descending and auto land will managing the speeds. At the approach
    phase , the pilot needs to enable both "LOC" and "APPR" when "NAV" and "G/S" are in range.
    However, if the "FD" button is selected and active, then the flight director will do this
    for you automatically.

    A word of caution on speeds. In managed modes, the appropriate speeds are determined by
    the FMC. However, it can only control the throttle and NOT the brakes. Therefore, if the
    plane is travelling too fast, it cannot reduce its speed. The pilot may need to apply
    the air brakes briefly to bring the speed back into line. This is more critical during
    the approach phase.

    Autoland will usually be accomplished if both LOC and APPR are set, providing the
    localizer and glideslipe were successfully intercepted. The FMC estimates if touchdown
    will be acheived given the current sink rate and forwaed speed. If it judges that this will
    not be acheived, it will issue a "go-around" command and initiate a climb. Hence, it
    is important to make sure that the approach speed is being abserved. Use brakes as
    necessary. The flaps settings significantly affect the approach speed needed.

    ========== Armament ==========
    The weapon load must be configured on ground before takeoff via the "Mission" menu.
    Weapons can only be fired when the aircraft is a safe height above the ground and
    reasonably stable i.e. manoeuvring. 
    The "master arm" must be on and the selected weapon must be armed.
    All these operations can be done on the control panel, "Mission" dialog or via key
    presses.
