Handley Page Victor Bomber/Tanker
---------------------------------

The Handley Page was one of the "V-Bombers", designed in the 1950s for long-range delivery of
nuclear weapons, and one of the parts of the UK nuclear deterent during the cold war.
The Victor was initially designef as a bomber bust was later modified for strategic
reconnaissanceand others converted into tankers.

The original FlightGear model of the victor was in fact a tanker, i.e. A Victor K2.
This implementation models various operational variants:
  * B.1   - Strategic bomber aircraft
  * B.1A  - Strategic bomber aircraft, with Red Steer tail warning radar and ECM suite
  * B.2   - Strategic bomber aircraft
  * B.2RS - Blue Steel-capable aircraft with RCo.17 Conway 201 engines
  * B(SR).2 - Strategic reconnaissance aircraft
  * K.2   - In-flight refuelling tanker

However, the body and appearance of the model is the K2 version is all cases. The only
difference between bombers and tanksrs is that the drogues are disabled in the bombers.

Aerodynamics
------------

This implementation has rather different flying characteristic from teh original version.
The first thing you will notice is that this version is less eager to takeoff. It also
requires higher flight and approach speeds.

Instruments
-----------

Many instruments have been added to this version even when they are not really faithful
to the real aircraft because they are simply copied from other aircraft. Some have buttons
while others can only be adjusted via dialogs. e.g. avionics instruments.

Armament
--------

The weapons available to the bomber versions depends on the variant selected in the
"Misson" dialog inthe Victor menu. That dialog also offers the appropriate weapon
selection. Once the parking brakes are realised, the weapon load cannot be changed.

The control panel had several switches and LEDs. The top row has the switches for the
weapons stations. To deploy a weapon, first switch the "Master Arm" on using the rightmost
switch. The arm the station by flicking its switch, providing the station is loaded. Its
LED will illuminate.

Firing the weapon requires the plane to be stable, i.e. pitch and roll no greater than
4 degrees. The plane should also be a safe elevation above ground. No target aiming is
available. You will only get a report of what the weapon hit in the end and a view of
its impact with sound effects. The impact and sound is much higher for nuclear weapons.

Conventional bombs can be loaded if desired. However a full load of 48 bombs will be loaded
- no partial loadding it available. You may jettison some of all of the remaining bombs
using the "jettison" switch on the pilot's side console.

Fuel System
-----------

The fuel system is heavily influenced by the real fuel system of an SR-71 but with its
unique tanks system. The gain purpose of this fuel system is to maintain the CoG of
the plane within safe limits. It does this automatically. The pilot can make further
adjustments by activating forward and aft fuel transfers. This is available via a dialog
"Fuel MgT" in the Victor menu.

Refuelling can be accomplished on the ground as long as the aircaft is stationary with the
barking brakes on. In the air, you will need to activate tanker operations then meet up
with the tanker. Once contact is made, refuelling can commence. The tanker can be tracked
automatically if the autopilot is on and the TACAN switch is at T/R or A/A.

Refuelling is started or stopped by the refuelling lid switch (actually just a key press).

Auto-Flight
============

The autoflfght is probably the most radical departure from the origianl model (as possibly
from the real aircaft). It is based on the autoflight systems in various aircraft, e.g.
707, A33X, A380, SR-71.

Two separate auto-flight modes exist. The Flight Management Computer (FMC)
runs the "managed" mode. In this mode, it determines all the lateral,
vertical and speed parameters. The second mode is run by the Flight Director
with input from the pilot. This is the "selected" mode. The pilot has a say
in some or all the lateral, vertical or speed parameters.

=== Managed Modes ===
Lateral
~~~~~~~
    * LEVEL - wings are set to level (tries to maintains current heading)
    * NAV - follow navigation course (from route manager)
    * LOC - follow LOCalizer signal
    * RUNWAY - align with runway heading

Vertical
~~~~~~~~
    * CLB - climb at variable vertical and air speeds to the target height
    * DES - descend at variable vertical and air speeds to the target height
    * ALT - maintain altitude set by the FMC
    * AGL - maintain set elevation above ground
    * CRUISE - maintain cruise altitude (and cruise speed)
    * LEVEL - maintain vertical speed at 0
    * G/S - follow glideslope

    Note that all the above modes control the airspeed via the throttles.
    The pilot has no say in the selected airspeed.

Speed
~~~~~
    * THR CLB - variable airspeed in vertical CLB, ALT, AGL or LEVEL modes
    * THR DES - variable airspeed in vertical DES, ALT, AGL or LEVEL modes
    * CRUISE - pilot set cruise speed used only in vertical CRUISE mode

=== Selected Modes ===
Lateral
~~~~~~~
    * HEADING - maintain heading set by pilot

Vertical
~~~~~~~~
    * OP CLB - climb at variable vertical speed to the target height while
        maintaining the set airspeed via pitch control
    * OP DES - descend at variable vertical speed to the target height while
        maintaining the set airspeed via pitch control
    * V/S - maintain a constant vertical speed set by the pilot
    * ALT - acquire or maintain the altitude set by the pilot
    * PITCH - maintain a constant pitch set by the pilot

    Note that unlike managed modes, some selected modes use pitch to control
    airspeed without changing the throttle level (where possible). The pilot
    can adjust the throttle levels are any time and the autopilot will adjust
    the pitch to compensate and return to the set airspeed.

Speed
~~~~~
    * SPEED - maintain a constant speed in knots set by the pilot
    * MACH - maintain a constant Mach speeed set by the pilot


=== Flight Stages and Phases ===
The FMC divides the flight into several stages:
        Takeoff ~ Initial Climb ~ Mission (with climb and descend parts) ~
        Approach ~ Land
The flight director divides the flight into phases (with some overlap with the
flight stages)
        Takeoff ~ Initial Climb ~ Cruise ~ Descend ~ Deceleration ~ Approach ~ Land

The pilot can define the cruise altitude, cruise speed, and deceleration altitude
in the "Autoflight" menu. All other pilot inputs are available in the
"Autopilot" dialog. Switching between these two modes is done via the same dialog.
Unless one needs to change altitude or direction, it is usually easier to use the
managed modes.

=== Autopilot ===
The autopilot can only be engaged after the "Takeoff" stage is complete (above 400 ft).
Initially, it starts in "selected" mode. The pilot can change the parameters and each
mode separately in the "Autopilot" dialog. If "managed" mode is selected for any part,
e..g lateral, then the pilot will no longer influence that part. If the route manager is
set and active, then setting all parts to managed allows the plane to fly itself to the
destination including descending and auto land will managing the speeds. At the approach
phase , the pilot needs to enable both "LOC" and "APPR" when "NAV" and "G/S" are in range.
However, if the "FD" button is selected and active, then the flight director will do this
for you automatically.

A word of caution on speeds. In managed modes, the appropriate speeds are determined by
the FMC. However, it can only control the throttle and NOT the brakes. Therefore, if the
plane is travelling too fast, it cannot reduce its speed. The pilot may need to apply
the air brakes briefly to bring the speed back into line. This is more critical during
the approach phase.

The deceleration phase is supposed to reduce this problem by slowing down plane during
descent to some acceptable speed before commencing the approach phase. If the
deceleration altitude is not chosen carefully, there will not be enough time for the
plane to slow down before reaching the approcch fixes. In this case, deploying the
speedbrakes will be necssary. The default deceleration height is 1,000 ft above the
(estimated) first approch fix. The pilot can change it in the "Autoflight" dialog.

Autoland will usually be accomplished if both LOC and APPR are set, providing the
localizer and glideslipe were successfully intercepted. The FMC estimates if touchdown
will be acheived given the current sink rate and forwaed speed. If it judges that this will
not be acheived, it will issue a "go-around" command and initiate a climb. Hence, it
is important to make sure that the approach speed is being abserved. Use brakes as
necessary. The flaps settings significantly affect the approach speed needed.


Operation:
----------
* Before takeoff, set the desired climb altitude and cruise altitude for both the FMC
  and FD modes. Also set the initial heading and speed.
* Above 4000 ft, engage the autopilot once the speed to close to the AP speed
* The AP will engage the following modes: HEADING, OP CLB and SPEED PITCH
* It will then attempt to climb to the FD set altitude at the current throttle settings
  while maintaining the set FD speed, All these parameters can be adjusted at any time.
* Once the target altitude is reached, the vertical mode will shift to ALT HOLD and the
  speed mode to SPEED THROTTLE.
* At any stage, the pilot may engage managed modes and the FMC will take over those
  sets of parameters (lateral, vertical or speed).
* Some modes are mutually incompatible. Theh verical mode will always override an
  incompatible speed mode. For example THR CLB vetical mode will enforce a THR CLB
  speed mode regardless of the pilot's selection. Equally, no other vertical mode will
  use THR CLB speed mode.
* Before the Top-if-Descent point, the managed vertical modes must be selected if you
  need a steady descent. Once the ToD point is used, a managed descent mode will be
  activated to take the plane all the way to autoland.
* Mach or KIAS are interhangely selected based on the estimate of the cross-over
  altitude. Normally no manual intervention is required. The pilot may nonetheless select
  either KIAS or Mach in the Autopilot dialog. However, in the approach phase, only KIAS
  is used.
* The drag chute may be prepared for deployment by opening itsdoor. It will then deploy
  automatically when the plane touches down. Unlike in the real plane, this chute is
  recoverable. It will be released in deployed incorrectly.


Engines
-------

Starting the engines can be laborious. For this reason, an autostert facility has been
provided.

=== Manual Start ===
    * Request the Palouste compressor starter => key "Ctrl-E"
    * Turn ON the engine master switch => key "#"
    * Turn ON the electric master switch => key "}"
    * Fire the starter => key ")" or "s"
    * The engine will spin up to a maximum of about 25% N2 (5.2% N1)
    * The engine cut-off switch is triggered automatically at this stage
    * Wait for the engine to to reach about 45% N2
    * Select the next engine and fire the starter again => key ")" or "s"
    * Wait for all engines to stabilise (~30% N1 and 60% N2)
    * The external starter resources are automatically disconnected
    * The engine will spin up to a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1)

=== Automatic Start ===
    * Request the Palouste compressor starter => key "Ctrl-E"
    * Either use the key "~" of select "Auto-start" in the victor menu
    * The system will start each engine in turn, including the APU
    * When all main engines are running, switch off the APU with key "Ctrl-F"
      If this is not done, the APU will continue to use fuel for no benefit
    * The external starter resources are automatically disconnected


================= INSTALLATION =================
This implementation of the Victor aircraft was never meant as a replacement of
the original version. The main body of the oriignal files are the same; some
have been modified; and then are several additions borrowed form various
aircraft models. So think of this implementation as merely an experiment
with the Victor aircraft.

To try out this experiment you will need to install the original version first.
Only then can you install the files from this version in the same directory
as the original. Any conflicting files should be overwritten, in particular
victor.xml and victor-set.xml. These two files are responsible for importing
most of the new additional files.

This model has some dependency on other aircraft models or addons which is
simply reuses. In particular the lights and sound effects are largely implemented
outside this model. So these will not work with a standalone model.

Lights
------

The external lights use one of three schemes: Classic, ALS or Rembrandt. By default,
the ALS scheme is selected but this is also influenced by a property value and the
user shader configuration. The switch between Classic and non-Classic schemes can
be accomplished by simply toggling a property (using the "L" key).

A seperate installation of the lights model will be needed for this to work.

Sounds
------

The model produces some sounds at certain events. These are mostly for entertainment
value, but some may have some other useful value - the warning sounds for example.
The aircraft model has a few self-contained sound files for its engines and landing
gear. All other sound files are derived from other aircraft on the standard FlightGear
sound files. The user can of-course change the default sounds in the sound configuration
file.

Currently, the model expects to find the following sound files in the standard FlightGear
directory:
  * gpu-startup and gpu-running - used by the external power source
  * apu-start, apu-run, apu-stop - used by the APU engine
  * starter_start - used by all engine when starting
  * whine - used by the engines when running
  * rumble and roll - used when the plane is on the ground
  * gear-lck - used by the landing gear
  * squeal - used when the plane lands
  * flaps - used when the flaps move
  * speedbrake - used when the speed brakes move
  * speedbrake-wind - used when brakes are applied and the plane is moving
  * wind1 - used when at all times
  * rain-windshield and rain - used when it rains
  * chute-deploy - used by the chute
  * door_close - used by the doors
  * control-lock - used by the doors
  * click,  click-v3, and scroll - used by the knobs and dials
  * switch - used by switches
  * engine-crank - used by the engines when starting
  * V1 - used by the annunciator
  * stall and autopilot-disengage - used by warning signals
  * aircraft-explode, aircraft-wings-detach, aircraft-crash, aircraft-water-crash,
    aircraft-crack, aircraft-creaking - crash and stress system
  * shlock, armament-release - used when weapons are released
  * explosion, missile-hit, cruise-missile-launch - used when weapons deploy

None of these are strictly necessary. The user may choose to disregard any or all of them.
